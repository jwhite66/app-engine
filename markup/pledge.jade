                    We are running an all or nothing campaign. If we
                    don’t meet our targets, you don’t get
                    charged. That way, you know that you will only be
                    charged if there’s enough money collected to make
                    a difference. So if we fail to meet our goal of
                    $1M by June 1st for the first round, or $5M by
                    July 1st for the second round, your pledge will
                    not be collected, and your card will not be
                    charged.
                  p Use this form to pledge.

              p.
                Some supporters may prefer to donate.  Donations are
                collected <em>immediately</em>, whether or not we
                successfully meet our goal. We use a 3rd party
                service, Democracy.com, to collect those donations.
                Donations <em>do</em> add to the pledge total for the
                purposes of finding out whether we have met our
                all-or-nothing pledge goals, though they will not show
                up on the progress bar immediately.
